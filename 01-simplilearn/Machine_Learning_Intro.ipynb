        "- Arthur Samuel coined the term `Machine Learning (ML)` in 1959.\n",
        "> ML is the ability of a machine to learn from and replicate human behaviour.\n",
        "> - it allows programs to learn automatically and make computers more intelligent.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "- Factors contributiong to Adoption in ML:\n",
        "  1. increased data capture through smart devices, phones, and the IOT\n",
        "  2. increase of computation power with Edge Devices (devices used by end-users)\n",
        "  3. better internet connectivity and bandwith\n",
        "---\n",
        "- Key differences between `Machine Learning (ML)`, `Deep Learning (DL)`, and `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`\n",
        "  - ML, DL, and AI often used interchangeably\n",
        "  1. `ML` refers to algorithms that learn and perform based on the data exposed to it.\n",
        "  2. `DL` refers to layers of neural networks built with Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
        "  3. `AI` levereges different techniques, including ML and DL to solve problems:\n",
        "    - AI chess paying\n",
        "---\n",
        "- **ML Algorithms** - set of instructions used to solve problems:\n",
        "  - they help *predict*, *classify*, or *improve* any software application\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "- **Uses of ML** - The predictions by ML are used to:\n",
        "  1. shape policies\n",
        "  2. make weather forecast\n",
        "  3. determine traffic rules, CO<sub>2</sub> emission, forest degradation, visibility in the sky, wildfire, heatwaves, and even the size of factory chimneys\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "- **Data and ML** - ML is dependent on data.\n",
        "  - Performance of algorithm is ecaluated based on the quality of the input data.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on wether the algorithm can self-train and predict a condition or needs to indetify patterns to derive outcomes, it can be divided into:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **supervised learning** - algoritm uses the data developed in supervised environdments to deliver an output. Inputs and outputs are known:\n",
        "  - linear regression\n",
        "  - logistic regression\n",
        "  - support vector machines\n",
        "  - decision trees\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Examples of Supervised Learning:\n",
        "  - prediction of temperature increase when year-wise temperature increase is known\n",
        "  - prediction of cropy yield when season-wise crop quality deterioration is known\n",
        "  - classification of waste when easte items(input) and the type of waste are known\n",
        "\n",
        "  Supervised learning helps two actions:\n",
        "  1. classification\n",
        "  2. regression\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Unsupervised Learning** - no superviser is required to prepare data as outputs amay not be known for such algorithms. The program finds hidden patterns and recognizes their relations.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Examples of Unsupervised Learning:\n",
        "   - identification of anomalies over geografical landscapes\n",
        "   - identification and grouping of crop rot\n",
        "   - identification of user groups, based on commonalities\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reinforced Learning** - the program learns from previous errors. Interpreter rewards the algorithm when it finds the correct solution. If the output is not proper, the algorithm reiterates until it finds a better result.\n",
        "  Examples:\n",
        "  - YouTube recommendations:\n",
        "    - Program shows the list of songs available when a user searches for a particular song.\n",
        "    - When user selects a specific song, the system trains itself to remember and deliver a similar result for future searches.\n",
        "  - Other examples:\n",
        "    - games where players can play with bots\n",
        "    - spell check\n",
